HELP="""
This script attempts to execute ncov-tools for postprocessing of SIGNAL sequencing data.
SIGNAL ncov_tools already prepares the filesystem but we cannot directly execute a snakemake workflow within another workflow.
This script acts as a liason between python snakemake and terminal bash, executing snakemake outside the background python workflow.
Results files will be moved to SIGNAL results to consolidate all needed files. 


First argument provided for this script is '-c' for the number of cores. Default value is 1.
Second argument is '-s' for SIGNAL results directory (namely the name) - much of the script operates on relative pathing
